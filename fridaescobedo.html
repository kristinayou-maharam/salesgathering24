<p id="speakerbio">
    Frida established her eponymous studio in Mexico City in 2006. The studio’s reputation, initially built on the strength of a series of competition-winning projects in her native country—including the renovation of the Hotel Boca Chica (2008), the El Eco Pavilion (2010), and the expansion of La Tallera Siqueiros in Cuernavaca (2012)—has achieved global scope since 2018, when she received the prestigious appointment to design the annual Serpentine Pavilion in London’s Kensington Gardens, becoming the youngest architect to that date to undertake the project. Most recently, she was appointed as the architect to design the new Modern & Contemporary Wing for The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, becoming the youngest and first woman to design a building for the institution. Following her appointment as the Design Architect for The Tang Wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Frida Escobedo opened a studio in New York City in 2022.
<br><br>
    Frida is the recipient of numerous accolades, including the Architectural League of New York’s Young Architects Forum Award (2009), the BIAU Prize (2014), the Architectural Review Emerging Architecture Award (2016), and the Architectural League Emerging Voices Award (2017). In 2019, she was honored as an International Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), and the studio was named by the seminal architecture magazine DOMUS as one of the world’s “100+ Best Architecture Firms.” The most recently, The Créateurs Design Association & Awards has named Frida as the recipient of Le Prix Charlotte Perriand for 2024.
<br><br>
    In addition to her practice, Frida has taught at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Architecture (2016), Planning and Preservation (2015), the Architectural Association of London (2016), Harvard’s Graduate School of Design (2016/2019), Rice University (2019), and, most recently, at the Yale University (2022).
