 In September 2023, she curated the exhibition Tetsuya Ishida: My Anxious Self, the first American retrospective of Japanese painter Tetsuya Ishida (1973–2005), at Gagosian Gallery in New York. In November 2023, Alemani organized Making Their Mark, the first public presentation in New York of the Shah Garg Collection, a major exhibition showcasing the works of more than 80 of the most significant women artists from the last eight decades. In January 2024, she will serve as the curator of Anu Põder: Space for My Body, the first solo exhibition presented outside Estonia of works by Anu Põder at Muzeum Susch. She also served as artistic director of the inaugural edition of Art Basel Cities: Buenos Aires in 2018 and was the curator of the Italian Pavilion at the 57th Venice Biennale in 2017.
