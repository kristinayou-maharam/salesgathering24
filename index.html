    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>l am excited to welcome you all to Palm Springs and the 2017 Maharam Gathering! We have an incredible few days ahead of us and I truly believe this will be one of our best meetings ever. 
<br><br>
        The purpose of the Maharam Gathering is to affirm the unique qualities that make us who we are and to recognize the people and processes that raise us to a level of excellence by any industry standard. It's a time to reflect on how far we've come over the last few years and to look ahead to see where we're going. Design is always the driver for us, and in addition to sharing strategic updates from across the company, we'll be also be hearing from a number of leading design thinkers who are actively reshaping the world as we know it.
        <br><br>
        I ask you to come to Palm Springs not as a participant, but as a contributor. Be ready to listen attentively, enlist your curiosity, share your thoughts, and most importantly, connect with each other-whether that's with someone you've known for years or maybe it's with a colleague you've never met before. Your engagement is essential and is what makes this meeting so inspiring, so a big thank you in advance for all of your efforts to be as present as possible and make our time together really count.
        <br><br><br>
        
        I can't wait to see you there!
        <br><br>
        Tony</p>
